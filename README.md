Make developing spigot/bukkit plugins easier. 
Simplifies the Bukkit API primarily by combining various interfaces with the constructor methods that generate objects of that interface. 

Ex. Rather than call Bukkit.createInventory(...) to get an Inventory, simply use new SimpleInventory(...) the way you normally would with a java class.
